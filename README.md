# OpenGL - HelloTriangle
-  A simple OpenGL application that renders a triangle with different RGB values for each vertex, and translates along the x-axis without using any Graphics engine and only with raw C++ and OpenGL.
- This application was created with the help of [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/), [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) libraries for C++.
- Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution.
- Don't forget to set the target to x86, or the libraries won't not work.
- OpenGL version 3.3 was used for compatibility purpose, but you can use the latest version if your graphics card driver supports it.
