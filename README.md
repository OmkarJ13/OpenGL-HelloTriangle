# OpenGL - HelloTriangle
# A simple OpenGL application that renders a triangle with different RGB values for each vertex, and translates along the x-axis without using any Graphics engine and only with raw C++ and OpenGL.
# This application was created with the help of GLEW, GLFW and GLM libraries for C++.
# Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution.
# Don't forget to set the target to x86, or the libraries would not work.
# OpenGL version 3.3 was used for compatibility purpose, but you can use the latest version if your graphics card drivers support it.
