# OpenGL - HelloTriangle
A simple OpenGL application that renders a triangle with different RGB values for each vertex, and translates along the x-axis without using any Graphics engine and only with raw C++ and OpenGL.
This application was created with the help of GLEW, GLFW and GLM libraries for C++.
Open the .sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution.
Don't forget to set the target to x86, or the libraries would not work.
OpenGL version 3.3 was used for compatibility purpose, but you can use the latest version if your graphics card drivers support it.
